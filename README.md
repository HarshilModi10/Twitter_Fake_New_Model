# Twitter Fake News Tracker 

## The Problem
he 24 hour news cycle, combined with a global viewer base has led to various "fake news" stories propagating accross social spheres before all the facts can be properly obtained and presented. Although news agencies may modify their articles with retractions as more information comes in, it is often too little too late. By the time the retractions are issued the original version of the story has already spread to secondary and tertiary viewers through social media platforms such as twitter. Cases such as the Nick Sandmann Controversy demonstrate the damage this can have on indivduals and society as a whole.

## The Solution
The goal of this software application is to create a model for the proliferation of fake news over the social media platform Twitter. By tracking how a fake news story spreads through a social network's sub population, we can analyze the factors that affect how quickly a story spreads and how many users within the network that it can reach. This information can be used by academics and administrators of social networks in order to curtail the proliferation and range that a story tagged as false or misleading can aquire. It can also be used to help design "counter-news" stories designed to reach secondary and tertiary consumers who may not have regular access to retractions applied to the original story.
