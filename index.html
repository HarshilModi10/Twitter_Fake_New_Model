                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The 24 hour news cycle, combined with a global viewer base has led to various "fake news" stories propagating
                            accross social spheres
                            before all the facts can be properly obtained and presented. Although news agencies may modify their articles
                            with retractions as
                            more information comes in, it is often too little too late. By the time the retractions are issued the original
                            version of the story
                            has already spread to secondary and tertiary viewers through social media platforms such as twitter. Cases such
                            as the

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The goal of this software application is to create a model for the proliferation of fake news over the social
                        media platform Twitter.
                        By tracking how a fake news story spreads through a social network's sub population, we can analyze the factors
                        that affect how quickly
                        a story spreads and how many users within the network that it can reach. This information can be used by
                        academics and administrators of
                        social networks in order to curtail the proliferation and range that a story tagged as false or misleading can
                        aquire. It can also be used
                        to help design "counter-news" stories designed to reach secondary and tertiary consumers who may not have
                        regular access to retractions
                        applied to the original story.

                            The main advantage to using a database to store all our
                            information is the scalability that it provides. In the 
                            future, we plan to handle much larger datsets of networks, 
                            and therefore a database on the cloud will allow us to 
                            offload all the heavy data from our personal storage devices.

                            The data stored in our database in used an input data 
                            for our main algorithm. The advantage to using a database
                            is that future queries will be much faster than a traditional storage
                            method. This will be useful as our data set gets larger and larger.
