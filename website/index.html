                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>The 24 hour news cycle, combined with a global viewer base has led to various "fake news" stories propagating
                    accross social spheres
                    before all the facts can be properly obtained and presented. Although news agencies may modify their articles
                    with retractions as
                    more information comes in, it is often too little too late. By the time the retractions are issued the original
                    version of the story
                    has already spread to secondary and tertiary viewers through social media platforms such as twitter. Cases such
                    as the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2019_Lincoln_Memorial_confrontation">Nick Sandmann
                        Controversy</a> demonstrate the
                    damage this can have on indivduals and society as a whole.

                <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal of this software application is to create a model for the proliferation of fake news over the social
                    media platform Twitter.
                    By tracking how a fake news story spreads through a social network's sub population, we can analyze the factors
                    that affect how quickly
                    a story spreads and how many users within the network that it can reach. This information can be used by
                    academics and administrators of
                    social networks in order to curtail the proliferation and range that a story tagged as false or misleading can
                    aquire. It can also be used
                    to help design "counter-news" stories designed to reach secondary and tertiary consumers who may not have
                    regular access to retractions
                    applied to the original story.
